### Preliminary Research on Applying the Concept of Data Diversity to Domain Adaptation

The overarching idea is to utilize perturbations in the input data (here we use data from different domains) to train multiple models with the same architecture to produce unique feature representations which can be used in conjunction to improve the downstream model performance.
